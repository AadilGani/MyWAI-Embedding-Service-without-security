# MyWAI-Embedding-Service-without-security
This repository contains a FastAPI-based embedding service for MyWAI, designed to process and store embeddings from various file types (PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, XLSX) using OllamaEmbeddings. The service reads files, splits the text into chunks, generates embeddings, and stores them in a PostgreSQL database with vector support.
